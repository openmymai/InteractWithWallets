# Interact with Wallets

- **Wallets** store your secret key and allow users to sign transactions
- **Hardware wallets** store your secret key on a separate device
- **Software wallets** use your computer for secure storage. On desktops, software wallets are often **browser extensions** that add the ability to connect to a wallet from a website. On mobile, wallet apps have their own browsers.
- Solana's **Wallet Adapter** allows you to build websites that can request a user's wallet address and propose transactions for them to sign
